## Introduction

This repository is intended to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding and implementing data structures in C++. It provides clear and well-documented implementations of various data structures commonly used in computer science and software development.

## Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures currently implemented in this repository:

1. [Linked List](link_to_linked_list)
2. [Stack](link_to_stack)
3. [Queue](link_to_queue)
4. [Binary Search Tree](link_to_bst)
5. [Hash Table](link_to_hash_table)

Each data structure has its own folder with detailed documentation and sample code.
